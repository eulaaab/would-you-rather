# Would You Rather Project - Eula

This is a project for Udacity called Would You Rather React & Redux course for React Nanodegree Program. Users can answer questions, see which questions they havenâ€™t answered, see how other people have voted, post questions, and see the ranking of users on the leaderboard. This project uses Material-UI as the frontend library because I wanted to learn how to use it.
